            PixelParty is an NFT Frame showcase built on the NEAR Protocol with
            a total supply of 600 tokens. Each token you own, allows you to draw
            on a 20x20px frame. <br />
            You could buy several connected frames to draw a larger frame.
            Additionally all frameholders will receive small rewards within the pixeltoken
            ecosystem from time to time.
